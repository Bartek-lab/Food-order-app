This project is a demo of food order app made in ReactJs.
To start this application on your server just fetch code and run npm start.
But it's not required, you can simply check it here : https://infallible-saha-152a89.netlify.app/

This is my first React Js project, which teached me a lot new stuff. I learned what is ReactJs and what are these famous components.
After this project I trully felt in love in React. It's really clean and straight forward. Ability to make separate components it's just awesome thing.

React Hooks in this projects:
- useState,
- useEffect,
- useContext,
- useRef,
 
I also used Router and Fragment. Design was made for mobile first. The data is "dummy" hard coded  especially for this project.

Making this project was really fun for me, i think that I should started  learn React faster, but in one time I'm happy that i spent more time for fundamentals.
